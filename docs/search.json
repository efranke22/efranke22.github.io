    "text": "In Spring 2022 I got to take Correlated Data (STAT 452) and learned about how to work with time series, longitudinal, and spatially correlated data. I enjoyed combining my passion of mapping with modeling techniques that account for spatial correlation in order to learn more about the critical issue of childhood lead exposure in the Twin Cities, which can cause damage to a child’s brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, and even comas or death with severe exposure. To learn more about what might cause elevated blood lead levels in children and where this issue is most apparent, check out our writeup on github."

    "text": "In Fall 2021 I took Econometrics (ECON 381) at Macalester College. With the COVID-19 pandemic still looming and consistently and feeling like doing a project related to my hometown, I decided to learn more about COVID-19 and residential property crime on the neighborhood level. Over the course of my analysis (March 2019 - Feb 2021), I found one neighborhood to have a significant increase in residential property crime (Lincoln Square) and 15 neighborhoods to have a significant decrease in residential property crime. Overall, I found significant evidence that property crime decreased for Chicago as a whole with the onset of the pandemic. My statistical methods included fixed and random effects modeling as well as Granger causality. Please check out my paper to learn more!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In summer 2021 I was lucky enough to be part of a 15 person research cohort with a focus on sports analytics through Carnegie Mellon. Not only did I get to learn so many awesome statistical techniques, but I also got to apply them to my favorite topic (baseball) with people who were equally as passionate as me. My research was done in partnership with Sarah Sult (Washington University in St. Louis) and Brooke Coneeny (Swarthmore College) and advised by Adam Brodie of the Houston Astros.\nSome of my main takeaways from this project were how deeply you have to think as a statistician about underlying assumptions. So many times we thought were proud of a model we had developed and ready to apply it, and then realized how it doesn’t take into account something crucial to the game of baseball (like how if a batter changes their swing they will be thrown different pitches). This was also my first time conducting formal team research and I learned how lucky I was to be able to work with people with different strengths than my own. Sarah and Brooke are both computer science majors and were able to use their skills to debug some of our more complicated functions while I focused on data visualization and modeling.\nPlease check out our project repository and most recent presentation to learn more about the complex relationship between launch angle/attack angle, exit velocity, and wOBA!"
