I am very grateful to have had many opportunities to work with real data during my undergrad! I believe working on projects is the best way to process what we learn and understand what we don't know (at least for me). Throughout college, I got exposure to many different methods and application areas. This allowed me to run into new challenges in the data analysis process, whether that be data cleaning and methods, report writing, or thinking more about data ethics. I worked on the projects below at Macalester. I occasionally look back on them to refresh my memory on coding tricks, concepts, and more :)
