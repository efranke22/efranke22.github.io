I am very grateful to have had many opportunities to work with real data during my undergrad! Working on projects is the best way for me to process what I learn and see what I don't know. Being exposed to many different methods and application areas allowed me to always run into new challenges in the data analysis process, whether that be data cleaning and methods, report writing, or thinking more about data ethics. I have decided to keep these on my website as they are a useful tool for me to look back on to remember coding tricks and more :)
