I am very grateful to have had many opportunities to work with real data during my undergrad! I personally find (a) applying methodology to data, and (b) making an effort to explain this work in writing or orally, to be the best way to process what I learn and understand what I don't know. I worked on the projects below at Macalester. I choose to keep them on my website as they have proved to be valuable resources to look back upon for coding tricks or concept refreshers.
