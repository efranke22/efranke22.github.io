I'm very grateful to have had many opportunities to work with real data during my time at Macalester. I personally find (a) applying methodology to data, and (b) making an effort to explain this work in writing or orally, to be the best way to process what I learn and understand what I don't know. I worked on these projects during my undergrad and keep them on my website for the role they played in developing my passion for statistics.
