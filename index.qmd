::: {#intro-heading}
I am a second-year Statistics PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) in Pittsburgh, PA. I graduated from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) in 2023, majoring in Statistics and minoring Computer Science and Economics.

[comment]: # I am passionate about using statistics as a tool to better understand and solve complex interdisciplinary problems for societal good. 

I recently completed a year-long project in collaboration with [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home?authuser=0) (CMU Stats & DS) and Phoebe Lam (CMU Psychology) that integrated existing studies to understand the influence of perceived stress and negative emotion on disease vulnerability. I am part of the CMU [Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) and am looking forward to starting research advised by [Will Townes](https://willtownes.github.io/) beginning in the spring semester. More information about past and current projects can be found on my [Research](https://efranke22.github.io/research.html) page.

At CMU, I have been fortunate to both TA and become involved in pedagogical research. Visit my [Teaching](https://efranke22.github.io/teaching.html) page to learn more about some recent projects.

### About Me

In addition to statistics & data science, I also enjoy all things running, hiking, volunteering with [Common Pantry](https://www.commonpantry.org/), entering the [CAUSE caption contest](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/caption-contest/2025), and spending time with friends and family.
