::: {#intro-heading}

Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Erin and I use she/her pronouns.

I am a first-year Statistics PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) in Pittsburgh, PA. 

I am passionate about working with data to solve problems for the greater benefit of society. One of my favorite parts of statistics is getting to collaborate with experts in all different fields---my past work has touched applications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, baseball, and gentrification. I am in the process of figuring out my primary research interests, though currently find problems with spatial data particularly interesting.

As both a student and teaching assistant, I enjoy thinking about effective ways to learn and teach statistics and data science. I look forward to further exploring this and gaining additional teaching experience throughout my PhD.

### About Me

In addition to statistics & data science, I also enjoy running, volunteering at my local food pantry in Chicago, hiking, going on walks while listening to podcasts, following women's pro running & the MLB, and spending time with friends and family. I am excited to be running the 2025 Chicago Marathon [to raise money](https://give.nourishinghopechi.org/fundraiser/5972974) for Nourishing Hope food pantry!
