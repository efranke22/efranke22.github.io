### Welcome!

::: {#intro-heading}
Hi, my name is Erin (she/her). <br>

I graduated from Macalester College in May 2023 as a Statistics major with Computer Science and Economics minors. I love working with data to make the world a better place and learning statistics and data science methodology along the way. Currently, I am working at Mayo Clinic as a Statistical Programmer on the CLL team. Please check out my [Projects](https://efranke22.github.io/projects.html) tab to learn more about my skills and see examples of my work.  <br>

In addition to statistics & data science, I also enjoy marathon training, triathlons, volunteering at my local food pantry in Chicago, hiking, watching Major League Baseball, and spending time with friends and family.
