::: {#intro-heading}
Hi, thanks for visiting my website!

I am a first-year Statistics PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) in Pittsburgh, PA. I graduated from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) in 2023, majoring in Statistics and minoring Computer Science and Economics.

I am passionate about using statistics as a tool to better understand and solve complex interdisciplinary problems for societal good. I am currently working with [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home?authuser=0) (CMU Stats & DS) and Phoebe Lam (CMU Psychology) to integrate existing studies in order to understand the influence of psychological stress on disease vulnerability, and whether social relationships, at what age, buffer this association.

As both a student and teaching assistant, I enjoy thinking about effective ways to learn and teach statistics and data science. Visit my [Teaching](https://efranke22.github.io/teaching.html) page to learn more about some recent projects.

### About Me

In addition to statistics & data science, I also enjoy running, volunteering at my local food pantry in Chicago, hiking, going on walks while listening to podcasts, following women's pro running & the MLB, and spending time with friends and family. This fall, I will be racing the 2025 Bank of America Chicago Marathon for charity, raising money for Nourishing Hope Food Pantry.
