Having the opportunity to collaborate with experts in a wide variety of fields is my favorite part of being a statistician. As I develop as a researcher, my goal is to contribute work that helps understand and solve complex interdisciplinary problems.

### Current Projects

1. In the Spring 2026 semester, I am looking forward to starting research advised by [Will Townes](https://willtownes.github.io/) as part of the CMU [Delphi group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/).

2. [Stress and Cold Susceptibility: Comparing Z-Score and Latent Measurement Models](research/erinfranke_finalADA.pdf)

- I recently completed this year-long project in collaboration with [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home?authuser=0) (CMU Stats & DS) and Phoebe Lam (CMU Psychology). We integrated existing studies to understand the influence of perceived stress and negative emotion on disease vulnerability using moderated nonlinear factor analysis (Bauer and Hussong, 2009).
- I am currently working on a spinoff paper, *A Comparison of Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis and Standardization Approaches for Psychological Research Using Integrated Data*, that extends our prior work. This paper will take further steps to understand the differences between moderated nonlinear factor analysis and z-scoring approaches through simulations and derivations.
