As a statistician, my goal is to contribute research that helps understand and solve complex interdisciplinary problems. 

For my year-long advanced data analysis project, I am working with [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home?authuser=0) (CMU Stats & DS) and Phoebe Lam (CMU Psychology). Our goal is to integrate five existing studies in order to understand the influence of psychological stress on disease vulnerability, and whether social relationships, at what age, buffer this association. Combining the studies creates a blockwise missingness pattern in the data, a challenge that we address using moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) with full information maximum likelihood.

Prior to starting my PhD, I interned for the Minnesota Twins and worked at Mayo Clinic on the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia team. Collaborating with experts in other fields is my favorite part of being a statistician. Throughout my PhD, I look forward to doing methodological work that can help support these types of collaborations.
