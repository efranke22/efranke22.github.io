Throughout my PhD, I am excited to gain teaching experience and conduct teaching-related research. This summer, I am enjoying TAing for the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Camp, which I was a student at in 2021 (full-circle moment!). I also [attended my first conference](https://efranke22.github.io/blog/uscots2025/), the United States Conference on Teaching Statistics, where I learned lots and presented two projects with my cohortmate [Sara Colando](https://scolando.github.io/).

-   Our first project aims to understand how the trajectory of undergraduate statistics student writing has changed since the introduction of ChatGPT. [\[Writeup here\]](./teaching/llmwriting/llmwriting.qmd).

-   Our second project focuses teaching data wrangling with the [data.table](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.17.0) R package.
