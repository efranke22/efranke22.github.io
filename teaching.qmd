Throughout my PhD, I am excited to gain teaching experience and conduct teaching-related research. This summer, I am enjoying TAing for the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Camp, which I was a student at in 2021 (full-circle moment!). I will also be attending the United States Conference on Teaching Statistics, where I am presenting two projects with my cohortmate [Sara Colando](https://scolando.github.io/). Our first project aims to understand how the trajectory of undergraduate statistics student writing has changed since the introduction of ChatGPT, and the second focuses teaching data manipulation with the [data.table](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/data.table/versions/1.17.0) R package.
