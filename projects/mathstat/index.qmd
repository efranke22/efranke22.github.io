In Spring 2022, I took Mathematical Statistics (STAT 455) where I deepened my understanding of theoretical statistics. Two of my classmates, Vivian Powell and Cheikh Fall, and I completed a final project on a topic of our choice which we taught to the remainder of our class. Given the importance of linear regression, we chose to dive deeper in a key assumption of ordinary least squares, exogeneity, and the consequences of omitted variable bias if this assumption does not hold.
