In Spring 2023 I had the opportunity to take Causal Inference (STAT 451) and complete a capstone project on a topic of choice. As a hiker, I was interested to learn about the value of oxygen when ascending the Himalayan Mountains. Please check out [**this website**](https://himalayancausality.netlify.app) to learn more about causal inference and this project.
